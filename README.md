## 📖 Project Overview
Airlines face a massive volume of social media noise. Genuine crises—like stranded passengers or lost medical equipment—often get buried under thousands of general complaints.

**VibeCheck** solves this by using a **Medallion Architecture Pipeline** to ingest tweets, classify them by urgency, and draft instant, context-aware responses.

### 🎯 The Solution
| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🚨 Urgency Detection** | Filters noise vs. crisis (e.g., "I missed my flight" vs. "I am stranded"). |
| **🤖 GenAI Agent** | Instantly drafts apologies tailored to the specific issue (Lost Bag vs. Cancellation). |
| **⚡ Real-Time Dashboard** | A Streamlit interface for support agents to monitor "Urgent Fires" live. |

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture
This project follows the **"Train Heavy, Deploy Light"** MLOps pattern.

### 1. The Backend (Databricks Lakehouse) 🏋️‍♂️
* **Pipeline:** A full ETL workflow built on Delta Lake.
    * **Bronze Layer:** Raw ingestion of the *Twitter US Airline Sentiment* dataset.
    * **Silver Layer:** Cleaned data with text normalization, Regex parsing, and Feature Hashing.
    * **Gold Layer:** Aggregated "Urgency" tables ready for ML training.
* **Model:** A **Gradient Boosted Tree (GBT)** Classifier trained using PySpark MLlib, achieving **84.7% Accuracy**.

### 2. The Frontend (Streamlit Inference) 🏎️
* The trained model's logic was ported to a lightweight Streamlit app for real-time inference with **<200ms latency**.

## 🔄 Automated Workflow Proof
The entire backend pipeline is orchestrated using **Databricks Jobs** to ensure reliability and repeatability.
